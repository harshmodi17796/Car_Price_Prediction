# Car Price Prediction

### Welcome to this project.

#### In this project, I am trying to predict the Used Car Price from 9 features such as Present Price, Kilometres Driven, Transmission System and so on. In this regression task, I will use various Machine learning algorithms such as Random forest and Linear regression. To work with dataset, I have used libraries such as NumPy, Pandas. For machine learning algorithms, the library called Sklearn and for visualization, the libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn have been used.
#### I have used a dataset from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho

#### For this project, I am following Mr. Krish Naik, a famous Indian Youtuber in Data Science field. You can find this project here: https://github.com/krishnaik06/Car-Price-Prediction

#### The difference between mentor’s project and my project is the explanation of each step, which I have understood, while going through his project and video. The detailed explanation behind the necessary steps has helped me to enhance my knowledge. I hope, you will also get some good things while going through my project.
